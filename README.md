# Description
Quran Murajaah Tracker is built to help keep track of the juzu'/surah/maqra/page that had been memorized. Actually I just built this web apps to try implementing Bootstrap in designing website and I found it quite handy as I usually use pure CSS in designing website before. I also try to familiar myself with localStorage and used it to store basic data (no credentials is stored).

# Tech Used
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. Bootstrap
5. localStorage
