## Description
Quran Murajaah Tracker is built to help keep track of the juzu'/surah/maqra/page that has been memorized. Actually, I just built this web app to try implementing Bootstrap in designing websites, and I found it quite handy as I usually use pure CSS in designing websites. I also tried to familiarize myself with localStorage and used it to store basic data (no credentials are stored).

## Tech Used
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. Bootstrap
5. localStorage

## New things I learned
1. How to utilize localStorage and its pros and cons
2. Familiarized myself on how to use onclick()
3. There are many cool things that can be done easily by using Bootstrap

## Note
Please don't laugh on how I list all the juz/surah/maqra/page. It is the most possible way that I can think of ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†
